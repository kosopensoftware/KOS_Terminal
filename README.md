About [KOS] Terminal:
---------------------
[KOS] Terminal is part of the [KOS] System Operations family of software. This program is designed to help windows users use their systems more efficiently by allowing them to avoid using the windows operating system directly. Rather than using a mouse to click your way around your system, the [KOS] Terminal allows users to use a terminal interface, where users can enter commands rather than use the windows interface.
The ultimate goal for this program is to make the use of systems that have windows operating systems more efficient to use by their users.

To run the python version of the program, the developer will need to ensure that the following python packages are installed:
os | shutil | datetime | subprocess | time | docx | ctypes | sys | re | copy | msvcrt | win32com.client | pythoncom
The Main.py or the run_py.bat script is capable of running the program. The Main.py script is the highest priority script for running the program. The setup.py script may also be useful for developers; this script will create a desktop and file area shortcut for the program. If developers have issues with downloading python files or if the full python version does not run, then it may be easier to contact the KOS developer at:
